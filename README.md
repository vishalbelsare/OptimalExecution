# (1)Please read the pdf file, which contains the framework
In this project, instead of using the traditional dynamic programming, I implement the RNN framework to try to optimize the parameters to find the best quotes. This pdf file is the framework, in which I prove that such a optimal problem could be solved by deep learning and it can converge to the optimal point.
